            <p>Hello! My name is Pedro Martins and I was born in Porto, Portugal back in 1992, having lived there since then. As a kid I realized very soon that I enjoyed solving problems, exhibiting odd behaviors such as bringing a fourth-grade math's exercise book to the beach in plain summer vacations when I was 10. I had my first computer by age 12 and I got addicted to it in no time. Both of these traits followed me in my teenage years and led me to pursue an informatics related future. </p>
            <p>I started taking a <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_ano_lectivo=2012&pv_curso_id=742">Master's degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/up/en/web_base.gera_pagina?p_pagina=feup">Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto</a> in 2010. Over the years, I've come in contact with many fields of computer science and software engineering, working with different concepts, languages and tools, all the while improving my soft skills as well. </p>
            <p> In 2016, I decided to spend one semester abroad within the Erasmus+ programme at the <a href="https://www.bme.hu/?language=en">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>. This experience dramatically improved my spoken English and allowed me to come across new, insightful cultures. </p>
            <p> Between all my academical duties, I always tried to involve myself in other extracurricular activities as well. Driven by my eagerness to meet new people, I joined programmes coordinated by the faculty to welcome new students into their new reality. I also co-organized or simply volunteered in several events and conferences either arranged by the faculty itself or by groups of other students. </p>
            <p> Besides all of this, I'm an avid moviegoer who tries to at least watch a movie a week. I also like retrogaming, to binge-watch the occasional TV show and to spend the night out at the bar with my friends. Oh, and I also love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesinha">francesinhas</a>. A lot!</p>
