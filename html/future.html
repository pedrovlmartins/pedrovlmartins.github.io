        <p>I'm currently developing my master's dissertation project entitled "<b>Gene prediction using Deep Learning</b>", which I expect to defend by July.</p>
        <p>After that, I want to work on a place where I can surround myself with great people and extend my knowledge on subjects I find interesting. Some of these include <b>web development </b> (especially <b>front-end development</b>), <b>software development</b> (with a keen interest in <b>algorithms</b> and <b>data structures</b>) and most recently <b>machine learning</b> (particularly neural network methods, such as <b>deep learning</b>). I'm also a fan of <b>agile methodologies</b>. </p>
